# Learning Flutter

In the way to learn Flutter, I'm going to create a simple app that will use the basic widgets and concepts of Flutter. Also, I'm going to use the following documentation and video tutorials:
 - [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)
 - [Flutter Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets)
 - ["Aprendiendo Flutter desde Cero para Creación de Aplicación Móvil Nativas" by midulive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uZjsHFob5s)


## 1. What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language (also owned by Google). Flutter was released in May 2017 and actually is in version 3.10.1.
Flutter is based on widgets, which are the building blocks of the user interface. Each widget is an immutable declaration of part of the user interface. Unlike other frameworks that separate views, view controllers, layouts, and other properties, Flutter has a consistent, unified object model: the widget.

Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. Dart is a modern, object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. Dart is easy to learn and offers the following features:

- A familiar syntax with a rich set of developer tools
- Every object is an instance of a class
- All variables store references to objects
- Supports top-level functions, variables, and classes
- Supports functions inside functions
